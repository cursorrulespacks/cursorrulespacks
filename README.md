# 👋 Hey, I'm nedcodes

I help developers get more out of Cursor AI. I test rules, build tooling, and write about what actually works (and what doesn't).

## What I do

- **[cursor-lint](https://github.com/cursorrulespacks/cursor-lint)** — Open source linter for Cursor rules. Catches broken configs before they waste your time.
- **[50+ free rules](https://github.com/cursorrulespacks/cursorrules-collection)** — The largest free collection of tested .cursorrules and .mdc files. Organized by language, framework, and practice.
- **[Articles](https://dev.to/nedcodes)** — Real tests, real results. No hype.

## Writing

Some stuff I've published:
- [I Tested Whether Cursor's Auto Mode Actually Picks the Right Model](https://dev.to/nedcodes/i-tested-whether-cursors-auto-mode-actually-picks-the-right-model-20ml)
- [Cursor Agent Mode Ignores .cursorrules — Use .mdc Instead](https://dev.to/nedcodes/cursor-agent-mode-ignores-cursorrules-use-mdc-instead-5flb)
- [I Tested Every Way .cursorrules Can Break](https://dev.to/nedcodes/i-tested-every-way-cursorrules-can-break-most-of-them-dont-pii)

## Need help with your Cursor setup?

I do async Cursor audits. I'll review your rules, project structure, and config, then tell you what's broken and how to fix it. No calls, just a written report with specific fixes.

DM me on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/nedcodes) or the [Cursor Forum](https://forum.cursor.com) (nedcodes on both).
